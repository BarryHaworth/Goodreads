The Story of the Two Goats

Once there were two goats wandering about in a junk yard looking for things to eat, and amonst all the other junk they found a big flat can.  They nuzzled it and managed to remove the lid, and inside was a reel of old celluloid film - a movie.  The movie began to unravel so the first goat ate a few frames off the end of it.  The second goat ate a few more, then the first goat agaian, and the second until before very long they had finished eatin the entire movie.

The first goat licked his lips meditatively and said, "You know that was a pretty good.  I really liked that movie."  The second goat thought for a bit and then replied, "Yes it wasn't bad, but I thought the book was better."
